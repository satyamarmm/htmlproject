      <p>You‚Äôll need to consider pick up locations ‚Äì where you‚Äôd like to collect your rental car for your journey. You‚Äôll find lots of car hire desks at the airport, which are very convenient but often cost more. There‚Äôs a good chance that the cost of hire will be lower if you book in advance online before you collect the car.</p>
    <p>To save even more you might want to consider picking up your rental car ‚Äì you can also say hire car ‚Äì from an out of town location, or a city centre location, rather than the airport. While this might not be as practical an option for those travelling as a group or with lots of luggage, car hire companies often charge you less money to pick up hire cars from these locations.</p>
<p>One more thing to consider is the car hire company‚Äôs list of drop off locations ‚Äì these are places where you can return the car when you‚Äôre finished your journey. When you do drop off the car it will be checked over for any signs of damage ‚Äì bumps, scrapes or dents and so on ‚Äì that you may be charged a fee for.</p>
